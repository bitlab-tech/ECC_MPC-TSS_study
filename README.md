# ECC_MPC-TSS_study

This repository contains proof-of-concept (POC) implementations and exploration of various cryptographic schemes, focusing on:

- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Study of secure cryptographic algorithms using elliptic curves, including key generation, encryption, and signature schemes.
- **Multiparty Computation (MPC)**: Exploration of secure computation protocols that allow multiple parties to compute a function without revealing their private inputs.
- **Threshold Secret Sharing (TSS)**: Implementation of threshold-based cryptographic schemes, where a secret is divided among multiple participants, and only a subset is needed to reconstruct the secret.

## Key Highlights:
- Implementation of core cryptographic primitives
- Secure multiparty computation with threshold cryptography
- POCs for privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols

This repository is ideal for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts exploring cryptographic protocols in distributed environments.
